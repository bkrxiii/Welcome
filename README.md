# Welcome to my GitHub

I discovered code during the first lockdown in the UK and absolutely love it.

I have a passion for coding, currently studying Applied Software Engineering at Cardiff University. Proficient in Python and Javascript.

I am currently working as a Chatbot Conversational Designer at Admiral Insurance; designing and developing chatbots that enhance customer experience.

I am motivated, self-driven and solutions-oriented, with a desire to learn new technologies, and eager to apply my skills to solve real-world problems.
