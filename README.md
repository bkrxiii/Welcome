# Welcome to my GitHub

I discovered code during the first lockdown in the UK and absolutely love it.

Iâ€™m a Junior Software Engineer with a passion for coding, currently studying Applied Software Engineering at Cardiff University. Proficient in Python and Javascript, I have recently picked up Go in my spare time and love it.

Through my studies I have solid fundamentals in SQLite and MySQL, Database design, OOP-principles, Java, Spring Boot, App Security, Bootstrap, and Flask.

I am currently working as a Chatbot Conversational Designer at Admiral Insurance; designing and developing chatbots that enhance customer experience.

I am motivated, self-driven and solutions-oriented, with a desire to learn new technologies, and eager to apply my skills to solve real-world problems.
