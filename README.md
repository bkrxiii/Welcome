# Welcome to my GitHub

I discovered code during the first lockdown in the UK and absolutely love it.

I have a passion for coding and am currently studying Applied Software Engineering at Cardiff University.

I am also currently working as a Chatbot Developer in FinTech.

I love solving problems, they are just puzzles after all ðŸ‘‹
